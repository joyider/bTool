\subsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of macro A\-S\-S\-E\-R\-T for the Arduino board. If the assertion fires the code attempts to write an error string into the global Serial object (its initialization therefore is a prerequisite of using A\-S\-S\-E\-R\-T), wait for a while and than makes a reset.
