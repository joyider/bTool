The tool c++filt writes the names and types of C objects to stdout if the
name as used on asssembler level are passed to the tool. Use this tool to
validate object names used in assembler code if they should be shared (in
either direction) between assember and C code. Example:
  avr-c++filt -n _ZL12waitForEventjbh
  ==> waitForEvent(unsigned int, bool, unsigned char)
